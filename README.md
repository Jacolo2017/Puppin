The premier dog meetup application for dog parents.

## App Summary

The premier dog meetup application for dog parents.

## Intended market

The people that we expect to use this are dog parents, dog lovers, and singles that own dogs. The intended audience is for adults looking to socialize their dogs and each other. With the help of the app, users are able to see events happening, host events, join events and meetup. Users can see the profile of those coming to the event and get virtually acquainted with their dogs. After the event completes, users can write a quick review of the event, the location, and the other attendees
