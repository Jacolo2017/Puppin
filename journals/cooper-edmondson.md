* FIXED THE LOGIN!!!! I worked on the expanded card and fixed it to expand to the specific one. Tweaked bugs, and fixed other errors. 

I FINALLY FIXED THE LOGIN AND THE EXPAND CARD. That was the most FRUSTRATING thing I have ever done. Map functions are so simple yes to tedious. This project has been so fun, and frustrating but my team has been amazing. I couldn't have asked for anyone better. Jack, Mark, and Roger have been my ROCK during this project. They adapted to the tailwind so quick and taught me more about FastAPI's. I know whatever company that hires any one of these guys will thrive. They are amazing. <3

* Finished the public profile page (different from the private profile page), changed all the links (for deployment), and reformatted all the front-end files

Created a seperate profile page for users who click on an event host to be taken to. It passes the account id of the event host (through a link tag) to the new profile page which renders all of their information, dogs, reviews, and events on. Reused all of the components from the private profile page. Also changed all of the front-end links (for deployment) and formatted all of the components/pages.

* Finished the profile page

This one was really fun to work with.  I made the profile page for the current user and it has a section that will render a new component based on the click of the user. For example, the review header will generate reviews, and so on. This page has been eye opening since I started working with hooks, and this page in particular made me feel more comfortable with hooks/states. We have some little things to do but for the most part we're done.

* Finished expandable card 

Roger helped me finish the expanded card function by using a tertiary function to change the state on click of the div. Honestly my mind was blown! I finished implementing the swiper and framer motion into the expanded card to give it a little flare. So far I am really proud of how hard everyone in my team is working. This team has been really insightful and I really like seeing the way everyone codes, and approaches a problem.

* Passed data into the events page and created an expandable card.

Today I worked on making each event card expandable and passing data into it. I also was able to fix an issue where the nav was being covered by the components, the solution was to change the z-axis of the navbar to always show on top. The expanded card is being a little trickier than expected but I know I can get it done.

* Started working on the profile page, and the events page.

I implemented swiper js to allow users to swipe through the different events that are happening. I have the basic idea of the profile page and there are several different components that need to be implemented. The events page is going to be the landing page users go to after logging in. There is a bug right now dealing with logging in but it'll be resolved soon.

* Finished the authentication.

Finally Finished the authentication with the whole group. The authentication was by far the hardest thing to implement in the project so far. It took WAYYY longer to complete the authentication than expected, but it works. I need to research authentication more, beacause my understanding of it isn't where I would like it to be.

* Finished the login page.

I finished the login page and started looking into the authorization for our project. I know a lot of components for the front end need to be able to check the current user, and be able to communicate with the backend without issues. I think that the authorization will be tricky to get right but when we get it, the project will be almost done. 

## 7/20/2022 -

* Finished the sign up form.  

Today I worked with hooks and created a multi-step sign up form for our project. I though that since to create an account we needed a lot of data that could be catagorized a multi-step form would allow it to look better. It turned out really well. I need to work on some of the logic but it posts.

* Tweaked the landing page for the project. 

Worked on some fake cards for the landing page and working on a developer section. I added a section with fake information (cards) so that the page looks more professional.  So far this is looking really nice. Right now my goals are to finish the events page, the profile page, login, auth, and sign up page.

* Finished the landing page for the project. 

I finished the landing page for puppin. Right now there are several tweaks that need to be made but other than that everything looks really good. On to creating some forms and creating the main page. Also I need to figure out login and logout. I created a hero section and navbar which will tell the user to go to either the login or sign up.

* Today my team worked on getting our project setup properly.

We created the microservices that we needed, added the react-app (for the front-end) and installed tailwind for our project. We ran into some issues originally setting it up but after looking at previous projects we set it up properly. I am very excited to start working with tailwind! Tailwind CSS seems like a challenge but I think it'll get easier with time.
