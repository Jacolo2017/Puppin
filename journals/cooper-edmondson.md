* Today my team worked on getting our project setup     properly.

We created the microservices that we needed, added the react-app (for the front-end) and installed tailwind for our project. We ran into some issues originally setting it up but after looking at previous projects we set it up properly. I am very excited to start working with tailwind!

* Finished the landing page for the project. 

I finished the landing page for puppin. Right now there are several tweaks that need to be made but other than that everything looks really good. On to creating some forms and creating the main page. Also I need to figure out login and logout.
