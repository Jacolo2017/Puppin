* Structuring the back End

Today we worked on structuring the app's back end. Ultimately we rushed into the creation of our microservices, and had to end up re-creating all of our projects, apps, and Dockerfile.devs. Luckily we could keep our .yml file the same which was what we did for a majority of the morning. 

I am looking forward to really starting the app. I'm not sure what service I will end up building. From the reviews service there will be a lot of sharing data and I would like to try out a pub/sub relationship, which we haven't had the chance to work with yet. 

It would be nice to work with the accounts service as well. I have some personal projects lined up after graduation that focus on users being able to log in and hold all their data and maybe even update locational data based on where the app is opened. 

Events, well that's the project we made for last module so it would be the easiest, but at the same time I feel like I would have to push it to its most optimal form, since I have the experience in it. 

I think puppin has a lot of potential, especially with Mark, Cooper, and Roger working on it as well. We have already had philosophical discussions about the rating of humans and how the systems will be sharing and accessing each others data. I have electric butterflies in my stomach!
