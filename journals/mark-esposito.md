Just a quick catch-up entry since I did not know about the journaling until the leanr was released. Last week we came up with the idea for the dog/person meetup site. We defined the basic structure and data model for the application. 

Today, The team screenshared to work on building the basic folder structure of the applications. We built three django applications for each of the microservices (accounts, events, reviews) as well as the react application to house the front end of the project. We were able to all start up with app with the database and the react in docker using docker compose. We worked out some kinks with the git branches and merges and defined a basic strategy for the git uploads (essentially following the guideline in "Git in a Group")
